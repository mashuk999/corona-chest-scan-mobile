# Solution Overview:
We are creating an app wherein the COVID-19 positive patients can be recommended whether they should go for the final lab testing or not, thus saving a major number of test kits that are used in vain.

# Solution Description:
The Corona crisis is real! Owing to the current situation, our labs are facing the shortage of COVID-19 test kits. Due to that, a significant number of suspected positive cases are being left untested while a major number of test kits are being used in vain to continuously detect if an active patient has recovered or not. Instead of the continuous testing, our app would let them know when they really need the final lab test in order to be considered as a ‘recovered’ case of COVID-19, just from the X-ray reports that the patient would upload.
Our app would analyse the patient’s X-ray report by implementing the magic of Machine Learning. The dataset has been trained with X-ray images of existing COVID-19 patients in order to be accurate with the resulting suggestion. The patients are required to upload the recent X-ray (CXR) and then within no time our app would process the result and display the suggestion. As long as it shows the presence of viral infection in the patient’s X-ray, our app would suggest them not to get ready for the final test and continue with the medication. Once the app marks them as “free from virus”, they will be suggested to confirm it using the lab test. Thus, we ensure that only one test kit is being used for each COVID-19 patient to consider them recovered.
There is no such existing alternative till date that could accurately recommend the patient regarding the correct time for lab test. With an accuracy of almost 90%, our app stands as the best possible way to decrease the uncalled-for usage of COVID-19 test kits and in turn increase its availability for indispensable cases.
